## Description

MOClib is a custom Python MOC library that uses the Astropy library to build MOC trees and serialization from HEALPix cells.
The library contains actually two classes: `Loader` and  `Moc_tree`. <br>
The `Loader` class is able to query a VOTable from Vizier, update the coordinate system if needed and create the HEALPix number associated to each object.
The `Moc_tree` class takes care of processing the cells from the HEALPix column of a astropy.Table object. A MOC serialization can be obtained from the Moc_tree class for further analysis.<br>
<br>
This package is composed of: the `moc_library module`, an example `jupyter notebook`, a `requirements.txt` file.


## Example

A Jupyter Notebook can be found in the package.<br>
It provides more details on how to use the library and what can be done with it.<br>
First, make sure you have installed jupyter on your python environnement: `pip install jupyter` before running the notebook.

But briefly, in a python file or notebook one can use the library like so :

```python
from moc_library import Loader, Moc_tree

loader = Loader(_catalogue='II/7A/catalog', _out_max=10000, _order=7, _source="CDS")
votable = loader.get_votable()
...
moc_tree = Moc_tree(_order=7)
moc_tree.build_moc_tree(votable)
...
```

## Installation

To install the package, please use pip or conda:

```shell
> pip install MOClib/
OR
> conda install MOClib/
```

This library needs additional libraries to run correctly. They can all be installed from the *requirements.txt* file like so:

```shell
> pip install -r requirements.txt
OR
> conda install --file requirements.txt
```
<br>

You should now be able to load the library in a notebook for instance.
